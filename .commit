refactor: simplify PIM to use only Odoo backend

- Remove mock PIM and all references to it
- Use getProductsByIds for all ID-based lookups (single ID is list of 1)
- Remove USE_ODOO_PIM environment variable toggle
- Remove POST/PUT endpoints that only worked with mock PIM
- Simplify API: id, ids, skus params for product lookup
