refactor: consolidate product fetching to search API and cleanup unused endpoints

- Add ids and skus query parameters to search API for batch product fetching
- Update ProductCarousel to use search API instead of dedicated products endpoint
- Rename /product/[productId] to /products/[productId] for consistent plural naming
- Remove unused backend endpoints: catalog, carts, cms, contacts, content,
  contracts, facilities, me, orders, organizations, pricing, reference
- Update backend route index to reflect current API structure
