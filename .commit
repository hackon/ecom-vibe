feat: use SKU as product ID instead of Odoo internal ID

- Update sync script to use SKU (default_code) as product ID for cleaner URLs
- Update odooPim adapter to use SKU as ID and look up products by SKU
- Simplify getProductById and getProductsByIds to use SKU-based lookups
- Product URLs are now /product/WD-0001 instead of /product/odoo-123
- Create unified sync script (products.json → Odoo → Solr)
- Remove old separate sync scripts (sync-odoo.ts, sync-solr.ts)
- Update package.json with unified `sync` command
- Update CLAUDE.md with new sync workflow documentation
