feat: implement CMS-driven landing page with carousels and hero banner

API Layer (following Frontend -> B4F -> Backend -> 3rdparty flow):
- Add /api/3rdparty/cms/pages - home page layout with blocks
- Add /api/3rdparty/cms/article/[slug] - article content
- Add /api/3rdparty/cms/content/[slug] - generic content blocks (mocked)
- Add /api/3rdparty/cms/store/[storeId] - store config (mocked)
- Add /api/backend/v1/pages - wraps 3rdparty cms/pages
- Add /api/backend/v1/article/[slug] - wraps 3rdparty cms/article
- Update /api/b4f to serve home page layout
- Add /api/b4f/article/[slug] for article content

CMS Mock Data:
- Home layout with carousel and hero-banner block types
- "Best January Deals" carousel (10 products, 4 visible)
- Free Shipping hero banner linking to article
- "Power Drill Offers" carousel (7 products, 4 visible)
- Two sample articles (free shipping policy, woodworking guide)

Components:
- ProductCarousel: horizontal scrolling product cards with navigation
- HeroBanner: promotional banner with link to article

Pages:
- Landing page fetches layout from B4F and renders blocks dynamically
- Article page at /article/[slug] with markdown-like content rendering
