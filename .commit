refactor: use sidebar navigation for admin views instead of tabs

- Move Customers and Products navigation to the existing sidebar menu
- Add Products nav item with Package icon to admin sidebar
- Use URL query params (?view=customers/products) for view switching
- Highlight active nav item based on current view
- Remove inline tabs from admin page content
- Wrap useSearchParams in Suspense boundaries for SSR compatibility
