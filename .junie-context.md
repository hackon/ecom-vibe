# Project Context: Carpentry E-Commerce Mimic

## Project Overview
This project is a React/Next.js application designed to mimic a complex enterprise e-commerce site for carpentry goods. It follows a strictly decoupled architecture using a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern.

## Architecture & API Layers
The `src/app/api` directory is divided into three distinct layers:
1. **/api/b4f**: The entry point for the frontend. Aggregates data from the backend APIs.
2. **/api/backend**: Business logic layer. Contains endpoints like `/user`, `/customer`, `/facility`, `/product`, and `/order`. These wrap the interfaces for 3rd-party services.
3. **/api/3rdparty**: Mocked external services including:
    - CMS (Content), CRM (Customer Relations), PIM (Product Info), ERP (Enterprise Resource), AD (Directory), and OAuth (Auth).

## Domain: Carpentry Goods
- **Products**: Timber, tools, hardware, bespoke furniture components.
- **Features**: Start page, global search, faceted navigation (filters), shopping cart, multi-step checkout, and user profiles.

## Coding Standards
- **Components**: High level of modularity. Use functional components with TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Clean, professional UI (minimalist "carpentry" aesthetic).
- **Type Safety**: Strictly typed interfaces for all API responses across layers.
